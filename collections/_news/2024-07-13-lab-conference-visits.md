Nils and I presented recent work at several meetings and caught up with developments in quantum fluids of atoms and light. 

Also, a vortex was spotted in King's Cross Station.

## Nils' conference marathon
Nils may have covered almost every relevant meeting in Europe in June/July, a great opportunity to absorb recent advances and present the JRS work to a wide audience of theory and experimental researchers. 

- [813 WE-Hereus Seminar](https://www.we-heraeus-stiftung.de/veranstaltungen/advances-in-quantum-simulation-and-sensing-with-ultracold-gases/) on Advances in Quantum Simulation and Sensing with Ultracold Gases in Bad Honnef.
- [YAO2024](https://yao2024.eu/), Young Atom Opticians conference in Strasbourg.
- [ICAP2024 summer school](https://icap28.com/summer-school/) held at St John's College, Oxford.
- [ICAP2024](https://icap28.com/) at Imperial College London.

## Paris etc
I had a fascinating visit to Labs in Paris, the ICAP 2024 conference in London, and the Dipolar Quantum Matter workshop in Durham. 

### Paris
Visited Aur√©lien Perrin and group at the CNRS Laser Physics Laboratory to learn more about their work on vortex lattice melting. 

During several days with [Quentin Glorieux group](https://lab.quentinglorieux.fr/) I learned a lot about the state of the art for quantum fluids of light experiments, and was even allowed to do things in the lab! Actually, this was closely supervised and I didn't touch anything important, but we worked on high fidelity injection of superfluid excitations and their imaging. Great fun! 

### ICAP 2024
A great meeting, [ICAP2024](https://icap28.com/), was held at Imperial College London. The big news was BEC of dipolar molecules at [Sebastian Will group](https://www.will-lab.com/), New York. 

There was also some 600 posters running over 3 days and 4 buildings. Thirsty work!

### Dipolar Quantum Matter Durham
This ICAP satellite meeting explored frontiers of [dipolar quantum matter](https://durham-qlm.uk/events/conferences/ICAP_satellite/) in theory and experiments.
