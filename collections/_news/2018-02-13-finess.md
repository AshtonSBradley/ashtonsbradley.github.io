The international meeting 
- [Finite Temperature Non-equilibrium Superfluid Systems](https://physics.otago.ac.nz/finess2018/) 

was held in Wanaka 19-23 February 2018 at the Edgewater Hotel on the lakefront. I was the local organiser and chair for the meeting.

The meeting involved around 100 participants and an exciting scientific programme covering latest developments in ultracold atoms and polariton superfluid systems

- Degenerate Bose and Fermi gases
- Strongly interacting systems
- Dipolar condensates
- Polariton and Exciton condensates
- Spinor quantum gases
- Optical lattices
- Open quantum systems
- Coarsening Dynamics
- Strongly correlated systems
- Thermalisation and prethermalisation
- Kibble-Zurek mechanism and critical phenomena
- Non-thermal fixed points and highly excited metastable states
- Quantum turbulence
- Solitons, vortices and collective phenomena
- Quantum quenches and phase transitions of interacting systems
- Quantum transport and hydrodynamics in strongly interacting systems
- Monte-Carlo methods for quantum dynamics
- C-field methods, such as classical field theory
- Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), truncated Wigner approximation
- Multi-configuration time-dependent methods such as MCTDHF
- Gutzwiller and related approaches for lattice systems
- Dynamical mean-field theory
- Methods for open systems such as master equations
- Exact solutions
