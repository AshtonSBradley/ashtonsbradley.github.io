Former BSc Honours student Tim Copland has come back from a stint in the commercial sector to work on new fast methods for vortex detection, classification, and visualisation in 3D quantum fluids.

Tim has a flair for solving challenging problems using the modern high-performance language [julia](https://julialang.org/). His work builds on our open source package [VortexDistributions.jl](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/VortexDistributions.jl).
