I gave an invited talk at the meeting 
- [Turbulence and Vortex Dynamics in 2D Quantum Fluids](https://www.icts.res.in/discussion-meeting/quflu) 

held on 26 February to 2 March 2024 at the Ramanujan Lecture Hall, at the
- [International Center for Theoretical Sciences, TATA Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.icts.res.in).

I presented recent work with Zain Mehdi, Stuart Szigeti, and Joe Hope on 
- [mutual friction and diffusion of two-dimensional quantum vortices](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.013184).
