I helped coordinate a one day satellite meeting for [ICOS2019](https://www.doddwalls.ac.nz/news/icols-2019) visitors on 15 July 2019. The meeting involved around 30 participants and featured a departmental seminar from Aidan Arnold (image, right) and a Public Lecture from Eric Cornell at Tuhura Otago Museum, Beautiful Science Gallery.
