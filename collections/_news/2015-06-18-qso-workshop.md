I had the pleasure to orgainse a [cold atoms workshop](https://quantum.otago.ac.nz/workshop2015.html) on 17-18 June 2015 at Arana College. 

Blair had a delicious cake made to mark the auspicious occasion of the 20th birthday of BEC!

The meeting involved around 30 participants and featured introductory lectures on synthetic gauge fields and vortices in superfluid helium and BEC by Sandy Fetter visiting from Stanford.
