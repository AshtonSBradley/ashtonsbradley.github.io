I gave two public talks on the history and applications of quantum mechanics. First at Tuhura Otago Museum, as a prelude to the play *Constellations*. Second, I presented a longer version at the Dunedin chapter of University of the Third Age.

## Tūhura Otago Museum
As a precursor to the play *Constellations* by Nick Payne that explores the philosophical side of quantum physics, I presented a short version of the talk at Tūhura Otago Museum on 29th May:

*Quantum What?*  
 
The word “quantum” gets tossed around a lot, so what does it mean? 
 
Join us in the Barclay Theatre to get a crash course in quantum physics from Associate Professor Ashton Bradley of Te Whai Ao – Dodd-Walls Centre at Otago. You’ll dive into the stranger-than-fiction rules that inspire some very fictional plots of movies, books, and TV shows, and explore some very real quantum technologies being researched and developed here in Aotearoa! 

## University of the Third Age
I presented a longer version of the talk at the [U3A Dunedin](https://u3adunedin.org.nz/) meeting on 10 September at the Balmacewan Golf Course. This was tremendous fun to present to such an interested and engaged audience!
