title: Quantum Optics
slug: quantum-optics
abstract: Many-body entanglement is central to many quantum phenomena. The interaction of light and matter generates entanglement between photons and atoms, sometimes in the form of useable quantum entanglement created via controlled nonlinear processes, for example in four photon interactions. Entanglement can be well understood in quantum phase space, the playground of quantum optics theory. We study measures of entanglement, and entanglement resources for quantum information applications.

## Light-Matter Interactions and many body dynamics
Interactions between light and matter can be exploited to create novel states of light. These may take the form of squeezed or antibunched single mode light, or entangled multimode states that can be leveraged for quantum information purposes. Analogues to such states can also be created in ultra-cold atom systems, through entangling tunnel coupling interactions. We explore parallels between optical and atomic realizations of engtangling interactions.

## Quantum fluid of light as a many body simulator
Optical quantum fluids are distinguished by precise experimental control and high fidelity non-destructive measurements. Ultra-precise control of initial states coupled with a wealth of information about the optical field opens many new areas for exploration. An intriguing possibility is to study dynamcis of the Bose-Hubbard transition in a quantum fluid of light loaded into an analogue lattice potential. 

## Synthetic Spatial Dimensions
Controlled temporal evolution can be used to create synthetic spatial dimensions by tailoring interaction terms in the system hamiltonian.
