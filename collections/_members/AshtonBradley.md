  After completing a MSc at the University of Auckland in 2001 I started PhD study in the group of Crispin Gardiner at the University of Victoria, finishing in 2005.

  In 2005 I took up a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Queensland in the Center of Excellence for Quantum-Atom Optics in the group of Matthew Davis. In 2008 I moved to the University of Otago as a research fellow supported by the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science, and Technology. In 2010 I was awarded a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship and Marsden Fast Start Grant. In 2016 I transitioned to a permanent faculty position at the University of Otago.

  #### Fellowships and Awards
  - 2011-2015 Rutherford Discovery Fellowship
  - 2008-2010 NZ Foundation for Research, Science, and Technology Research Fellowship.
  - 2005-2007 University of Queensland Postdoctoral Fellowship.
  - 2003-2005 NZ Tertiary Education Commission Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarship.
  - 1998 University of Auckland Senior Prize in Mathematics, Senior Prize in Physics.

          On completion of my PhD studies I took up a postoctoral position at the University of Queensland in the ARC Center of Excellence for Quantum-Atom Optics, joining the group of Matt Davis. 
          
          In addition to working with Matt Davis on the Kibble-Zurek mechanism of vortex formation in BEC, I also had fruitful collaborations with Murray Olsen and Margaret Reid on quantum entanglement. 

          During this time I also started a new collaboration with Olivier Pfister's quantum optics group at the University of Virginia on tripartite entanglement. I also started a collaboration with Brian Anderson at the Wyant College of Optical Sciences in Tucson Arizona on quantum vortex dynamics.

          In 2001 I moved to Wellington to start my PhD research with Crispin Gardiner on several topics in the field of ultracold gases, including anomalous segregation, and rotating Bose-Einstein condensation. During this time I developed the first working simulations of the Stochastic Projected Gross-Piteavskii equation, and started collaborations with Murray Olsen and Blair Blakie.

          My interest in laser physics led me to a research project on non-Markovian atom lasers - the kind of laser that typically happens when massive bosons are playing the role of photons.
