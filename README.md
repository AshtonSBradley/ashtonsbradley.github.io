# Quantum Fluids Group

This is the website of our academic research group at Sorbonne University.
This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. 

## Install

[Clone](https://github.com/quentinglorieux/) this repository.

Install Jekyll (see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)).
Go to your folder and run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
Your demo site is available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Local dev
To run it locally : `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Set-up the content

### Create your publication list
There is a Python function to generate automatically your publication list from your name or your ORCID identifier.

#### Example use:
Type ` cd python `, then 

```python ExtractPubli.py "Quentin Glorieux"``` , or 

```python ExtractPubli.py "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0903-0233"```

It will create a file based on your publications in the _datas/publications folder.

### Load your assets
Load your images in the `images` folder. 
- in the `home_carousel` folder, put the files for the carousel on the homepage.
- in the `logo` folder, put the logo for the homepage.
- in the `members` folder, put your members.
- in the `members/placeholders` folder, put the images for missing members.
- in the `news` folder, put your news.
- in the `research` folder, put your research.

## Edit your datas (members list and publications)
Open the `_data` folder and edit the yaml files.

### Fundings
Open the `fundings.yml` file, then edit your fundings following yml syntax:
```yaml
- name: Agence Nationale de la Recherche
  projectID: XR204957
  acronym: GDSOU
  link: https://anr.fr/ 
  link_text: (ANR)
```

### Publications
Open the `_data/publications` folder then the `full_list_openalex.yaml` is supposed to be populated with your publication data (see Create your Publication list above).
Then the file `highlights.yaml` contains the highlighted publications (with a picture). 
The picture must be saved in `images/highlights/`
The format is 
```yaml
- title: High-Resolution Coherent Probe Spectroscopy of a Polariton Quantum Fluid
  image: bragg_polariton1.webp
  description: 
    A promising spectroscopy technique to measure the dispersion relation of a Polariton Quantum Fluid
    even at very low momenta, and with access to the ghost (negative energy) modes.
```

### Team members
Open the `team` folder.
#### Current members 
For current members edit the `members.yml` file with the following yml syntax:
```yaml
- name: Hanna Le Jeannic
  tagline: Quantum Hanna
  photo: Hanna.webp
  info: CNRS Researcher
  status: PI
  email: 
  education1: Postdoc at NBI (Peter Lodhal group)
  education2: PhD at LKB (Laurat group)
  education3: MSc at ESPCI
  ```
  You can add up to 5 `eduactions`. It can includes *html* or *md* formating.
  Photos are stored in the `images/members/` folder

#### Alumni members 
For alumni members (when a PhD or a postdoc leaves) edit the `alumni_members.yml` file with the following yml syntax:
```yaml
- name: Quentin Fontaine
  tagline: Experimental theoritician
  photo: QuentinF.webp
  duration: PhD from 2017 to 2020
  thesis: Titre
  email: 
  now_at: C2N
  ```
Copy paste from the members.yml but remove the `education` and `status` fields and add `duration`, `thesis` and `now_at` fields.
Photos are stored in the `images/members/` folder

#### Alumni visitors 
For alumni visitors (when a visitor, bachelor or master students leaves) edit the `alumni_visitors.yml` file with the following yml syntax:
```yaml
- name: BSc (X), Spring 2017
  status: bsc
  pdf:
  ```

## Edit the Pages
### Homepage
Open the `_pages` folder then `home.md`
This file contains the markup for the homepage.
Some HTML codes are included using e.g. `{% include carousel.html %}`.
Do not edit this part (except if you want to remove it from the template).
This file content can be modified using *markdown* syntax.

### Job page 
Open the `_pages` folder then `openings.md`.
This file contains the markup for the job page.

## Edit the collections
There are 4 collections:
- members: for detailled pages of each member
- news: for the news of the homepage
- research: to list the research topics
- projects: to present the recent research projects

### Member collection
Optionnaly you can add you personnal homepage to the site.
To do so create a file `yourName.md` in `collections/members/` by copying another file (the template).

Then you just fill the yaml frontmatter to add different section to your homepage

The publication section is generated automatically via another yaml file. To create it use the Python script `MyPubli.py`
```python 
python MyPubli.py 'Quentin Glorieux or ORCID' 'filename'
```


### News collection

### Research collection
Edit the md files with this frontmatter:
```yaml

title: Superfluidity
slug: superfluidity
abstract : Superfluidity is one of the most striking manifestation of quantum many-body physics. Initially observed in liquid Helium, the realization of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) has allowed detailed investigations of this macroscopic quantum phenomenon exploiting the precise control over the system parameters.
