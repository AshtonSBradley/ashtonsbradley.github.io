We explore dynamics and statistical mechanics of atomic **Bose-Einstein condensates** (BEC) and **Quantum Fluids of Light** (QFL).
<br>

The intersection of ultracold atoms and quantum optics is a rich playground featuring pristine experimental control and many novel quantum and nonlinear phenomena are under active investigation. Ultracold gas experiments afford a rich interplay between many body interactions, geometry, and optical manipulations that continues to yield new physics. Recently developed optical platforms manifesting quantum fluid effects such as superfluidity have opened up rich new fields for exploration.

We are a quantum theory group at the [University of Otago](http://physics.otago.ac.nz) 
interested in a quantum fluid dynamics, vortices and turbulence, finite temperature superfluids, and entanglement in optical and optomechanical systems. <br>
We use methods of quantum field theory, quantum optics, and computational physics to study quantum many body phenomena, with a keen eye on experimental developments.

**Job Offers:**
We are looking for talented new PhD and Masters students to join the team [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**
